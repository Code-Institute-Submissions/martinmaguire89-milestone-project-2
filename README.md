# milestone-project-2
# Pawcation
Please click on link to see my full working webpage for [Pawcation](https://martinmaguire89.github.io/milestone-project-2/).

My second milestone project is an interactive front-end site. The site allows potential users to interact with the site and search the map for places to stay that are dog friendly. The buttons allow for the user to narrow down their search for specific arrears in Northern Ireland. 

## UX
### Who is the target audience?
*	This website is for people wanting to take a holiday but also bring there pet with them.
*	holiday makers from the south of ireland and gret britain looking for a posisble city break with their dog.

### How does this attract our target audience?
The user gets a brief outline about what the pawcation website is about, what exactly is shown on the website and what it has to offer. The typography was designed to be fun and eye catching for dog lovers when they visit the site. A single page website makes it easy to navigate to the map to search for their desired destination. The info window is easy for the user to select and the link to the website makes it simple for them to check out the hotel and obtain more info. 
## User Stories
*	As a user, I want the initial page to be eye catching.
*	As a user, I want it to be easy to navigate.
*	As a user, I want to have an easy way to get further information on the hotel and possibly book.
*	As a user, I want an easy contact method if I wish for my establishment to be added to the website. 
## Wireframe
* link to my [balsamiq wireframe](https://github.com/martinmaguire89/milestone-project-2/blob/master/milestone%20project-2.pdf)
*	I decided to use Balsamiq to create my wireframe because it was recommended in the milestone project and by code institute mentors on slack.

## Features
### Feature 1 – Large dog picture.
The large dog picture is designed to show a fun and welcoming side of the web page. It’s used to provoke the image of their own dog enjoying themselves on holiday with the owner. It show’s them that this is a fun and easy to use website that will serve their needs.
### Feature 2 –  Paragraph section.
The small paragraph is just a few lines to let the customer know what this page is about and how the needs of them and their dogs will be catered for. 
### Feature 4 – Search by counties.
The search by counties allows the user to narrow down the search field on the map. If they are looking to search for dog friendly hotels in a specific county they can simply do that at the click of the button.  
### Feature 5 – The map section.
The maps section allows for a complete look of all potential place to stay with a dog in Northern Ireland.   The markers section allows for them to see where the hotels are and the info window provides them with a link to the hotel for making a booking.

## Features Left to Implement
* Add a payment feature for sticks available.
* A review section to let people know of other customers experience when buying hurls form this maker.
* Create a section to share information about the art of Stick making and some events that the maker will have coming up at local hurley clubs clubs. 

## Testing
* Used Google Chrome developer tools to test website responsiveness across multiple devices such as Tablets and Mobiles.
* Tested that the nav links worked and took they customer to the desired section of the website. Tests on all device sizes when in ‘burger icon’. 
* Used [W3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate both HTML and CSS. I copied my code and pasted it into the validator to check for errors and warnings.
* Tested the contact form for the required attribute. With this attribute it will not let you submit the form with the required information. To test this, I tried to send the form without the required information but was not let until all information was given correctly.
* I used [cssautoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to help get the appropriate vendor prefixes needed for my code to work in all browsers. I tested this on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla.

## Issues when Testing
* On certain screen sizes smaller than a large view all sections where being pushed to the left leaving a long blue column down the right making the page look unappealing of smaller screens. This was due to the YouTube videos no being responsive. I used iframe css to make the videos become more responsive when on smaller screen to the original size of the videos.
* The pictures of the hurls where leaking over into the next container and stretching passed their container when on smaller screen sizes. I used flex classes from bootstrap to allow for a more responsive and flowing change to how many pictures where on each row. This allowed for all picture to stay with their container. 
* When testing on different browser I found the code had not been optimised and used [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to optimize it. I copied and pasted the code and it added the necessary code to fix this.
## Deployment
