My second milestone project is webpage with .
## UX
### Who is the target audience?
*	This website is for people wanting to take a holiday but also bring there pet with them
*	holiday makers from the south of ireland and gret britain looking for a posisble city break with their dog.

### How does this attract our target audience?
The user gets a brief outline about what the pawcation website is about, what exactly is shown on the website and what it has to offer. The typography was designed to be fun and eye catching for dog lovers when they visit the site. A single page website makes it easy to navigate to the map to search for their desired destination. The info window is easy for the user to select and the link to the website makes it simple for them to check out the hotel and obtain more info. 
## User Stories
*	As a user, I want pleasing to the eye
*	As a user, I want it to be easy to navigate
*	As a user, I want to have an easy way to get further information on the hotel and possibly book.
*	As a user, I want an easy contact method if I wish for my establishment to be added to the website. 
## Wireframe
* link to my [balsamiq wireframe](https://github.com/martinmaguire89/milestone-project-2/blob/master/milestone%20project-2.pdf)
*	I decided to use Balsamiq to create my wireframe because it was recommended in the milestone project and by code institute mentors on slack.

## Technologies used

*	CSS
*	[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used to style the fonts of the website.
*	[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - To make certain features function on the page.
*	[git](https://github.com/)- Used as a repository
*	[aws educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)- Used for a development and testing area.

*	[fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for social media icons.
## Features
### Feature 1 – Navigation Bar
The navigation bar to take the customers direct to certain features on the website. This collapses into a 'burger icon' dropdown menu in mobile screen sizes to reduce over-crowding and give smaller screen sizes a nicer look.
### Feature 2 – Gallery
Customers can see how previous pieces of work the maker has crafted and range of hurls available. 
### Feature 4 – Embedded Video
Let’s the customer see the history of hurley making and find out more about the maker and his passion for making authentic hand-crafted hurls. 
### Feature 5 – Contact Form
Allows potential customers to ask questions about pieces in the gallery or to start the process of ordering a piece.
### Feature 6 – Social media icons in footer
Allows the customer to connect and follow the craftsman’s other pages.
## Features Left to Implement
* Add a payment feature for sticks available.
* A review section to let people know of other customers experience when buying hurls form this maker.
* Create a section to share information about the art of Stick making and some events that the maker will have coming up at local hurley clubs clubs. 
## Testing
* Used Google Chrome developer tools to test website responsiveness across multiple devices such as Tablets and Mobiles.
* Tested that the nav links worked and took they customer to the desired section of the website. Tests on all device sizes when in ‘burger icon’. 
* Used [W3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate both HTML and CSS. I copied my code and pasted it into the validator to check for errors and warnings.
* Tested the contact form for the required attribute. With this attribute it will not let you submit the form with the required information. To test this, I tried to send the form without the required information but was not let until all information was given correctly.
* I used [cssautoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to help get the appropriate vendor prefixes needed for my code to work in all browsers. I tested this on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla.

## Issues when Testing
* On certain screen sizes smaller than a large view all sections where being pushed to the left leaving a long blue column down the right making the page look unappealing of smaller screens. This was due to the YouTube videos no being responsive. I used iframe css to make the videos become more responsive when on smaller screen to the original size of the videos.
* The pictures of the hurls where leaking over into the next container and stretching passed their container when on smaller screen sizes. I used flex classes from bootstrap to allow for a more responsive and flowing change to how many pictures where on each row. This allowed for all picture to stay with their container. 
* When testing on different browser I found the code had not been optimised and used [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to optimize it. I copied and pasted the code and it added the necessary code to fix this.
## Deployment
